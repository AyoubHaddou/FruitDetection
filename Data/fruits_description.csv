Apple,"Apples come in all shades of reds, greens, yellows. 
 7500 varieties of apples are grown throughout the world. 
 ArithmeticErrorApples are fat, sodium, and cholesterol free. 
 A medium apple is about 80 calories. 
 Apples are a great source of the fibre pectin. One apple has five grams of fibre. 
 25 percent of an apple's volume is air. That is why they float.  
 Apples ripen six to ten times faster at room temperature than if they were refrigerated.  
 The old saying, “an apple a day, keeps the doctor away”. This saying comes from am old English adage, “To eat an apple before going to bed, will make the doctor beg his bread.”  
 Don't peel your apple. Two-thirds of the fibre and lots of antioxidants are found in the peel Antioxidants help to reduce damage to cells, which can trigger some diseases. 
"
Apricot,"One apricot has only 17 calories. 
 Apricots are an excellent source of vitamin A and a good source of vitamin C, dietary fiber, and potassium. 
 The fruit is a member of the rosaceae or rose family and is closely related to the similar-looking peach and plum. 
 In Latin, the apricot is called praecocquum, which means <<early-ripening peach>> 
 . Apricots originated in Asia more than 4,000 years ago, migrating to Persia and the Mediterranean before Spanish explorers brought them to the United States. 
 In China, apricots were once called <moons of the faithful> and were thought to enhance women's fertility."
Avocado,"Avocados have royal roots. The podcast Gastropod reports that avocados were first used as tributes from townsfolk to local royalty in Mesoamerica 7,000 years ago. 
 Avocados are in the same family as cinnamon. Seriously.
 Half of an average-sized avocado has 4.6 grams of fiber — the most of any fruit! 
 An avocado has more potassium than a banana. Honestly! Avocados have a whopping 975 milligrams of potassium, whereas a banana typically has 544 milligrams.  
 California produces 90% of the U.S. avocado crop. The avocado star of California is San Diego County, which produces 40% of all California-grown avocados. 
 In the summer of 2017, more than 3,000,000 photos of avocado toast were uploaded to Instagram every day.  
 If you’re looking for a healthy immune system, eat an avocado. The National Cancer Institute found that an avocado has 19 milligrams of glutathione per ½ fruit! Glutathione functions as an antioxidant which helps your immune system function normally. 
 A 2018 study published in the Journal of the American Heart Association found that eating an avocado a day can help improve LDL levels in overweight people. Of course, this is only possible if an avocado a day is part of an overall cholesterol-lowering, moderate-fat diet. 
 Would an avocado by any other name be as delicious? Well, it turns out, yes. Avocados have been called many things throughout history, including: ahuacatl by the Aztecs, aguacate by the Spanish conquistadors, and “alligator pears” by Sir Hans Sloane. The word “avocado” didn’t appear in the lexicon until the US Department of Agriculture decided that “avocado” was much more appealing than “alligator pear.”  
 The word “guacamole” is a derivation of the Aztec word ahuacamolli, which translates loosely to “avocado soup” or “avocado sauce.”"
Banana,"Bananas are a good source of vitamin C, potassium and dietary fibre. 
 Bananas have no fat, cholesterol or sodium. 
 Bananas are great for athletic and fitness activity because they replenish necessary carbohydrates, glycogen and body fluids burned during exercise. 
 Bananas are available all year-round. They are harvested every day of the year. 
 The banana industry in Australia is well over 100 years old. 
 A cluster of bananas is called a hand and consists of 10 to 20 bananas, which are known as fingers. 
 When you compare it to an apple, it has four times the protein, twice the carbohydrate, three times the phosphorus, five times the vitamin A and iron, and twice the other vitamins and minerals.  
 Queensland grower Pacific Coast Eco-Bananas has registered the colour red - applied as a wax on up to a third of the fruit - as a trademark. The grower hopes to become the only grower allowed to use the colour to distinguish and promote its bananas in Australia. It is believed to be the first colour trademark registered for fresh fruit."
Beetroot,"Beetroots are related to Swiss chard, spinach, and quinoa. 
 The Romans considered beetroot an aphrodisiac, possibly because they are a good source of tryptophane, betaine and boron, which affect mood and sex hormones in both men and women. 
 Ever had a moment of panic in the bathroom after consuming beetroot? The (harmless) condition responsible is called “beeturia” and apparently only affects around 14% of the population. 
 Can’t stand beetroot? You’re in good company.  Famous beetroot haters include the Obamas and Albert Einstein."
Blueberry,"One large handful (1/2 a cup) of juicy blueberries contains just 44 calories but has 2 grams of dietary fibre and 10% of your daily recommended vitamin C content. 
 Blueberries ranked number one in antioxidant health benefits in a comparison with more than 40 fresh fruits and vegetables. 
 The blueberry is one of the only foods that is truly naturally blue in colour. The pigment that gives blueberries their distinctive colour—called anthocyanin—is the same compound that provides the blueberry’s amazing health benefits. 
 People have been eating blueberries for more than 13,000 years. 
 The blueberry (genus Vaccinum) is one of the only commercially-available fruits that is native to North America. 
 Blueberries were called “star fruits” by North American indigenous peoples because of the five-pointed star shape that is formed at the blossom end of the berry. 
 A single blueberry bush can produce as many as 6,000 blueberries per year. 
 British Columbia is the largest highbush blueberry growing region in the world. As a country, Canada ranks third behind the US and Chile. Blueberries are Canada’s most exported fruit. 
 The silvery sheen (or “bloom”) found on the skin of blueberries is a naturally occurring compound that helps protect the fruit. This why you should only wash blueberries right before you’re going to eat them. The berries should be stored in the refrigerator and will keep fresh for up to 10 days. 
 Consumption of blueberries has been linked to health benefits including a reduced risk of cancer, increased insulin response, a reversal in age-related memory loss, and lowering blood pressure."

 Cantaloupes are related to watermelon, honeydew, cucumbers, pumpkins, and squash. "
Caspicum,"A capsicum is a species of fruit that is popularly eaten as a vegetable, and is native to tropical areas of North and South America. 
 ‘Capsicums’ are also known  as ‘peppers’, ‘sweet peppers’, and ‘bell peppers’. 
 The scientific name of a common capsicum is Capsicum annum and it is from the family Solanaceae, the family of nightshades. 
 The colour of capsicums ranges greatly, though they are more commonly red, green or yellow in colour, but purple, brown, white and orange varieties are also available. 
 China was the largest producer of capsicums in 2007, with a total production of 14,033,000 tonnes (15,468,700 tons) out of the world total of 26,056,900 tonnes (28,722,800 tons).Red capsicums, compared to green, orange and yellow ones, are the sweetest, especially if they are not picked until ripe, while the green coloured fruit are the least sweet and are often just unripened red fruit. 
 It is thought that capsicums where first cultivated around 5000 BC, and the first European to discover the fruit was Christopher Columbus, when he visited the West Indies. 
 Capsicums, or sweet peppers, are unusual in that they do not contain capsaicin, which gives others in the genus of the same name, including chili peppers, a hot spicy flavour. 
 Capsicums are extremely high in vitamin C and high in vitamin A, and depending on the variety, they may also contain significant quantities of vitamins B6 and K, and folate, and they also contain many other vitamins and minerals. 
 Capsicums are eaten both raw and cooked, often as a side vegetable, especially due to the vegetable’s crispiness. "

Carrot,"People first grew carrots as medicine, not food, for a variety of ailments. 
 Carrots can be traced back about 5,000 years through historical documents and paintings. No one knows exactly when the first carrots appeared, because many people mistook them for parsnips, a close relative of the carrot. 
 A medium-size carrot has 25 calories, 6 grams of carbs, and 2 grams of fiber. The veggie is an excellent source of vitamin A, providing more than 200% of your daily requirement in just one carrot. Carrots are loaded with beta-carotene, a natural chemical that the body changes into vitamin A. The deeper orange the carrot, the more beta-carotene you’re getting. 
 We think of carrots as orange, but they can also be white, yellow, red, and purple. 
 Mel Blanc, the voice of cartoon character Bugs Bunny, reportedly did not like carrots.The deeper orange the carrot, the more beta-carotene you’re getting."
